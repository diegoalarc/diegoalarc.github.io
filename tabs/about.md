# More about me

I am a person with a passion for learning and exploring. So much so that in 2016 I changed my life and went on a trip to South America, visiting several countries and stopping in Colombia, where everything changed for me.

Then I concentrated all my efforts and I came to Germany to study a Master in an area that I am passionate about, Remote Sensing, where I discovered another passion which is programming.

Currently I am working in Germany in a company for the Geospatial area, where I am still learning new skills and always looking for a place to expand my career.

I am also participating in the __Spanish__ community on __[Slack Latincoding](https://join.slack.com/t/latincoding/shared_invite/zt-nnhgkb43-1ccg6DgMnyJU28zMHs~CJw)__.

I have created one of the few geodesy packages for R, called __[GeodesiCL](https://github.com/diegoalarc/GeodesiCL)__.

I am currently __mentoring independently__ young people in Chile, in order to __empower talent__.

I hope you enjoy my short page and find enough information about me.
