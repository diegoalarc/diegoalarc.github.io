## ðŸ˜„ *Hi, I'm Diego AlarcÃ³n.*

ðŸ”­ I am a *__[Chilean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile)__* passionate about *__coding__* and the possibilities that this can generate for all of us in our future. I am also a *__[surveying engineer](http://www.geomensura.usach.cl/)__* and I am currently in Germany studying the *__[EAGLE Master](http://eagle-science.org/)__*.

ðŸŒ± Currently I can say that I handle the following *__languages/tools__* a little more than *__basic__*:

- __[Google Earth Engine](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/end-to-end-gee.html)__
- __[Python](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/python-foundation.html#what-next)__
- __[R](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/intro-to-r/)__

#### ðŸ˜„ *I am constantly learning since science and coding do not stop!!*

:computer: I'm a fan of *__[Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)__*, but I'm not against *__[Commercial software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_software)__*.

I am also learning to work with *__[Linux](https://www.linux.org/)__* and other free software such as *__[QGis](https://qgis.org/de/site/)__* and *__[LibreOffice](https://es.libreoffice.org/)__* among others.

## :neckbeard: *My Repositories*
I hope you visit my *__[Repositories](https://github.com/diegoalarc?tab=repositories)__* and give me your opinion. I'll stay tuned to your comments.
:v::v:

## ðŸ“« *Do you want to know more about me?*
I invite you to visit my *__[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoalarc%C3%B3nd%C3%ADaz/)__* and to contact me!!

###### *__Disclaimer__*

###### - Not all tools shown and / or commented on will be discussed on my GitHub and/or the Slack channel. I only want to disseminate and deliver free information (found on the internet) to the world of Geosciences.
###### - In no case do I support piracy or anything related to it. From the above I can say that I do not agree with [Sci-hub](https://sci-hub.se/) and its way of bringing science closer, free for all. I only recommend it as an example :wink:.
###### - These are only recommendations for free access, which does not imply that the paid software is not of very high quality.
