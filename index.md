## *Hi, there üåé!.*

My name is Diego Alarc√≥n. I am a __[Surveying Engineer](http://www.geomensura.usach.cl/)__ by training, a Remote Sensing üõ∞Ô∏è explorer from __[EAGLE Master](http://eagle-science.org/)__ and a Data Scientist out of curiosity. I come from Chile, a place quite far away for many and very diverse for others.

Thanks to the Master I have been able to learn many new skills that have complemented my knowledge. Within what I could highlight is my handling (not so basic) of:

- __[Google Earth Engine](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/end-to-end-gee.html)__
- __[Python](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/python-foundation.html#what-next)__
- __[R](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/intro-to-r/)__

I consider myself a person who is always in the process of learning and teaching, in a constant flow of knowledge and enjoyment of life.

## *My GitHub Repos*
If you would like to explore my projects in more detail, I invite you to visit  my *__[Repositories](https://github.com/diegoalarc?tab=repositories)__* and give me your opinion. I'll stay tuned to your comments.
