## *Hi, I'm Diego Alarcón 😄.*

I am a *__[Chilean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile)__* passionate about *__coding__* and __Remote Sensing__* with the possibilities that this can generate for all of us in our future. I am also a *__[surveying engineer](http://www.geomensura.usach.cl/)__* and I am currently working in Germany after finished the *__[EAGLE Master](http://eagle-science.org/)__*.

Currently I can say that I handle the following *__languages/tools__* a little more than *__basic__* 🌱:

- __[Google Earth Engine](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/end-to-end-gee.html)__
- __[Python](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/python-foundation.html#what-next)__
- __[R](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/intro-to-r/)__

I'm a fan of *__[Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)__*, but I'm not against *__[Commercial software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_software)__*.

I am constantly learning to work with *__[Linux](https://www.linux.org/)__* and other free software such as *__[QGis](https://qgis.org/de/site/)__* and *__[LibreOffice](https://es.libreoffice.org/)__* among others.

## *My Repositories*
If you would like to explore my projects in more detail, I invite you to visit  my *__[Repositories](https://github.com/diegoalarc?tab=repositories)__* and give me your opinion. I'll stay tuned to your comments.

## More about me

I am also participating in the *__Spanish__* community on *__[Slack Latincoding](https://join.slack.com/t/latincoding/shared_invite/zt-nnhgkb43-1ccg6DgMnyJU28zMHs~CJw)__*.

I have created one of the few geodesy packages for R.

I am currently mentoring independently young people in Chile, in order to empower talent.

I hope you enjoy my short page and find enough information about me.
